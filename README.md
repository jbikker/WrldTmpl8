# BRIEF INFO ON THE 2021 WORLD TEMPLATE

Project website: https://jacco.ompf2.com/voxel-world-template/

*Purpose:*

This template has been designed to make it easy to start coding C++
using games and 3D graphics. The world is 3D, but consists of a
finite amount of 'voxels' (3D pixels): exactly 1024x1024x1024 are
available to you. Programming games on this 3D 'screen' closely
resembles how we created games on homecomputers - but without the
now outdated 2D graphics.
At the same time, the template is nothing like large engines, like
Unity and Unreal. You get full control over your machine, and you
are welcome to dive deep into the template code, to change it as
you wish, once you are ready to do so.
